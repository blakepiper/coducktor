 * `~/.cezar/ui-state.json` — global GUI state, the workspace twin of the
 * per-repo `.ai/cezar/ui-state.json` (spec 2026-07-20-multi-project-workspace,
 * Data Model). Same split as `src/ui-state.ts`: this module owns the tolerant
 * read and the atomic write; the schema and key cap live at the route boundary
 * (`GET/PUT /api/workspace/ui-state`, step 2.7). The state is an opaque
 * `.passthrough()`-style bag — cross-project prefs (appearance, notifications,
 * curated skills) live here; project-scoped prefs stay in each repo's own file,
 * and prefs that describe the BROWSER rather than the workspace (sidebar
 * collapse, the last visited location) stay in that browser's localStorage.

/** Read `~/.cezar/ui-state.json` on demand — never cached, never throws.
 *  Missing, unreadable, malformed, or non-object all degrade to `{}`.
 *
 *  Typed by the CONTRACT (`WorkspaceUiState`) for the same reason as its per-repo twin in
 *  `src/ui-state.ts`: `GET /api/v1/workspace/ui-state` answers this value verbatim, so a loose
 *  record left the route naming no key. The schema is a `z.looseObject`, so unknown prefs keep
 *  round-tripping (BACKWARD_COMPATIBILITY.md §3) — the type only adds the known names. */
