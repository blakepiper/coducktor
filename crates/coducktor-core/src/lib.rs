//! Durable state, workflows, skills, Git helpers, and run lifecycle for Coducktor.
//!
//! This crate is the source of truth for the local file and workflow behavior used by the
//! in-process engine and terminal UI. All writes preserve the repository's compatibility and
//! atomicity rules; presentation and agent-wire details stay in their owning crates.
